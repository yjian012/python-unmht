# unmht

Very basic python tool that extracts resources from an MHTML file and saves them
to a directory for viewing / further processing.

Usage:

```
python3 unmht.py example.mhtml
```
Default output : "/files". To change output directory, add option "-o path/to/directory".

`getCss.py` can generate html tags to include all extracted css files, makes it easier to copy into the main html file.

Fixed:

HTML file without extension is added ".html" extension.

Script resources with question mark, eg 'src="/path/to/script.js?v=3"', the question mark and afterwards are removed.

Css files whose location is "cid:****@mthml.blink" are extracted.


Known bug:

Sometimes some links to style sheets are removed from the main html file, I don't know why. The `getCss.py` is created for manually adding the tags.


Current goal:

Converting "mht" and "mhtml" files, whose sources are no longer accessible on the internet, into single html files, similar to what SingleFile extension does. It seems that SingleFile can't process local html file that links to local resources. A workaround is, run a python server in a directory, then use unmht.py to extract the html and resource files into that folder, open server in browser, then use SingleFile to convert it into a single html file.

Ultimate goal:

Convert "mht" or "mhtml" file directly into a single html file. Probably it can be implemented by using a dict to get all resource locations and data, then replace the links in the html data with the actual resource data.
